You're a blob. An innocent little slime in your cave minding your own business.  

The cave is your playground, and it's usually peaceful.  

However, recently the cave was disturbed by an unknown entity. Now you must navigate your way through each room, avoiding blocks smeared by an otherworldy matter!
