## Workstation Setup

This project is powered by [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/), which needs to be installed as a first step. After that's setup, navigate to the project's folder and install the project dependencies.

```shell
poetry install --with=dev
```

From there on, contributors can use ```poetry shell``` once or ```poetry run``` at the start of terminal commands to have access to the project's virtual environment, where the dependencies were installed.

## Version Control

To make sure everyone knows how to work with Git and GitHub, I'd like everyone to add their names to the end of this file.
To do this, you must clone this repository, create a new branch for your changes, check out the branch, make the changes,
commit, push, and finally request to merge into main.  

I agree that I have done those steps:
- Anonymous4045
- hkohko (heko)
- Zander (dluiscosta)
